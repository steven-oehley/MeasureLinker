# MeasureLinker 📏

<hr>

This is a metric conversion app which allows a user to provide an input number.
The app will then take this number and convert it, showing output for length, mass and volume.
A user can either click the convert button or press enter after providing input to the input field to see results.

The app also has a light and dark mode feature, allowing the user to switch between the two modes based on their preference.

A webmaifest file was used to allow users to download the app on their phone and have it appear as a mobile application.

The project is available to view <a href="https://measurelinker.netlify.app/">here</a>.
